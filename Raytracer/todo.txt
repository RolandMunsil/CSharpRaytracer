* 3D rendering (like side-by-side and stuff)
 * Colored light
 * Objects to make
   - Torus
   - Hyperbola(s)?
   - Pyramid?
   - Cone
 * Lenslike camera
 * Orthographic projection
 * Bezier surfaces
 * Calculate pixel with floating point color componets
 * Revamp color system with La*b* / Lch, + spectrums
 * Material system - material has color/texture/colorfunc, refraction, reflection, diffuseness, etc.
	- Separate geometry (the shape of the object) from behavior (reflectance, color, etc.)
